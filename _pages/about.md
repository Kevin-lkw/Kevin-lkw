Hi! I am Kewei Lian (连可为). I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Peking University, school of EECS. 
I am now in the team of [CraftJavis](https://craftjarvis.github.io/), advised by Prof. [Yitao Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KVzR1XEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in the field of building generally capable agents in open-world environments, such as Minecraft.I also have broad interests in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular focus on generative models such as transformers and diffusion models. 

Prior to that, I worked with Prof [Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/) on the topic of NLP.
